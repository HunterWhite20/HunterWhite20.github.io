<h1>Github.io Introduction</h1>
<p>My name is Hunter White, and I graduated from Cato-Meridian Senior High School.
I played football, wrestling, and ran track. I was captain and MVP that brought our team to the Sectional Championship for only the 3rd time in our school's history.
Although we lost, we were content with out 9-1 record. I also am top 3 among winningest wrestlers in my school's history.
With such a strong athletic background, my hobbies include working out as well as going on runs. I also have a very large family,
so I love spending as much time as I can with them. </p>
